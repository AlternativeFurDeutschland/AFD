# Problems with AfD Website

## Overview
This website aims to highlight the issues associated with the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, particularly in the context of contemporary Germany. It discusses various problematic aspects of the AfD's ideology and actions and why right-wing parties like the AfD may not be suitable for a modern democratic state like Germany.

## Purpose
The purpose of creating this website is to provide information and raise awareness about the potential dangers posed by right-wing extremism and populist movements, as exemplified by the AfD. By outlining the problems associated with the AfD's rhetoric and policies, the website aims to encourage critical thinking and informed discourse among visitors.
